 * Holds the pipeline steering system. Pipeline steering is a
 * algorithm that generates steering output based on co-operation
 * between different experts: a Targeter that knows where it wants to
 * go, Constraints that know where to avoid, Decomposers know how to
 * decompose goals into sub-goals (pathfinding for example). This file
 * contains the interfaces for you to create new experts, and a series
 * of concrete classes that can be used directly.
