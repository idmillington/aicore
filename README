Installation
============

The code can be extracted to any directory.


Platform Compatibility
======================

The software has been designed for platform indepedence as much as
possible. The only file that may need altering for your platform is
./src/timing.cpp which currently wraps the windows multimedia timer.


Building
========

Building with Scons
-------------------

The code can be built using SCONS, available from
http://www.scons.org/. Simply cd (change directory) into the build 
directory and type scons.

> cd build
> scons

To remove intermediate files after building (but leaving the library
and demos):

> scons -c ../src


Building with Microsoft Visual Studio 8 Professional
----------------------------------------------------

Solution and project files are included for use with Microsoft visual
studio 8 professional. They may also work with Express edition, but
I've not tested that.


Building with CMake on Linux
----------------------------

The code can be built on Linux (and possibly on other platforms)
using CMake:

  cd build
  cmake .
  make

Documentation
-------------

To build the documentation (see below) you must have doxygen
installed (it is available from http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/
Simply cd into the ./doc/build/doxygen directory, then type:

> doxygen aicore.config

to build the documentation.


Layout
======

The build process creates a statically linked library in ./lib which
can be used with the include headers in ./include. The demo programs
are built and placed in the ./bin directory.

Source code is contained in the ./src directory, and documentation
is in the ./doc directory, in particular the reference documentation
is in the ./doc/ref directory.


Documentation
=============

The source code is heavily documented, and the contents correspond to
the discussion in the "Artificial Intelligence for Games" book.

It is possible to create 'doxygen' documentation with the tags in the
source code files, and a configuration for building the documentation
is provided in the ./doc/build/doxygen directory. The doxygen
configuration supplied provides only html output, since other output
formats depend on how your machine is configured.

This is not currently targeted from the scons configuration, because
scons suport for doxygen depends on where doxygen is installed on your
machine.


Demos
=====

To run the demos you will require OpenGL and GLUT installed on your
machine, and the relevant DLLs or shared objects on the path.
